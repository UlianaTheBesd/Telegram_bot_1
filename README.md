# Telegram_bot_1
*This is my first (and simple) bot designed to register Russian students for a course.*

You can see it here: [let_school_bot.py](let_school_bot.py).

What have I learned during the process of making this bot:
1) Using AI can simplify a lot of hard cases.
2) Better to have another device in order to test your code.
3) VS Code is a nice application, from which you can control the work of your code, even if it's placed on a server.
4) Just as VS Code, PowerShell enables me to have an access to my server (just like PuTTY or FileZilla - both did't work in my case).
5) GitHub is a platform where I can share my works, so that later I can measure my progress.

Well, I guess that's all for now. See you later!
