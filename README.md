# Telegram_bot_1
*This is my first (and simple) bot designed to register Russian students for a course.*

You can see it here: [let_school_bot.py](let_school_bot.py).

### What have I learned during the process of making this bot:
1) Using AI can simplify a lot of hard cases, but I should't use it too much in order to master the skill of bot making (or any other skill).
2) Better to have another device in order to test your code.
3) VS Code is a nice application, from which you can control the work of your code, even if it's placed on a server.
4) Just as VS Code, PowerShell enables me to have an access to my server (just like PuTTY or FileZilla - both did't work in my case).
5) GitHub is a platform where I can share my works, so that later I can measure my progress.
6) The bot won't send messages to speciall user (based on their id) if this user haven't started the bot on their device (will send "Sending Error" to the user, in my case).

### What do I like about this bot:
- It's behavior is based on user's id. If you're an Admin (you can add the id of your accout to the code), you'll get only speciall messages and won't be bothered by questionnaire.
- This is my first bot and I love that it works.

Well, I guess that's all for now. See you later!
